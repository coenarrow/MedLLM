<s>Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
Given your profession as a doctor, please provide responses to the medical questions using the patient's description.
Analyze the question by option and answer with the best option.

### Input:
###Question: A researcher is studying the properties of an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to glucose. She discovers that the enzyme is present in most body tissues and is located in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. She decides to mix this enzyme under subphysiologic conditions with varying levels of glucose in order to determine the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Specifically, she adds increasing levels of glucose at a saturating concentration of phosphate and sees that the rate at which glucose becomes phosphorylated gets faster at higher levels of glucose. She observes that this rate approaches a maximum speed and calls this speed Y. She then determines the concentration of glucose that is needed to make the enzyme function at half the speed Y and calls this concentration X. Which of the following is most likely true about the properties of this enzyme?
###Options:
A. High X and high Y
B. High X and low Y
C. Low X and high Y
D. Low X and low Y


### Response:

A. High X and high Y


### Correct answer:

A. High X and high Y


### Explanation:

The correct answer is A. The enzyme is most likely to be a glucokinase, which is an enzyme that adds a phosphate group to glucose. Glucokinase is found in the liver and kidney and is responsible for regulating the blood glucose level. The enzyme is saturated by glucose at a concentration of 100 mM. The enzyme is present in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. The enzyme is present in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. The enzyme is present in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme. The enzyme is present in the cytoplasm of the cells expressing the enzyme.
