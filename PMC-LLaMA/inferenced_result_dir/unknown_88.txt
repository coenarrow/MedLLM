<s>Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
As a medical professional, your responsibility is to address the medical questions using the patient's description.
Analyze the question and answer with the best option.

### Input:
###Question: An investigator is studying the modification of newly formed polypeptides in plated eukaryotic cells. After the polypeptides are released from the ribosome, a chemically-tagged protein attaches covalently to lysine residues on the polypeptide chain, forming a modified polypeptide. When a barrel-shaped complex is added to the cytoplasm, the modified polypeptide lyses, resulting in individual amino acids and the chemically-tagged proteins. Which of the following post-translational modifications has most likely occurred?
###Options:
A. Glycosylation
B. Phosphorylation
C. Carboxylation
D. Ubiquitination


### Response:

A. Glycosylation -Incorrect. Glycosylation is the addition of a carbohydrate molecule to a protein.

B. Phosphorylation -Incorrect. Phosphorylation is the addition of a phosphate group to a protein.

C. Carboxylation -Incorrect. Carboxylation is the addition of an acid group to a protein.

D. Ubiquitination -Correct. Ubiquitination is the addition of a ubiquitin molecule to a protein.
