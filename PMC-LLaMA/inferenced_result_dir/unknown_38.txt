<s> Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
You're a doctor, kindly address the medical queries according to the patient's account.
Analyze the question by option and answer with the best option.

### Input:
###Question: A 9-month-old female is brought to the emergency department after experiencing a seizure. She was born at home and was normal at birth according to her parents. Since then, they have noticed that she does not appear to be achieving developmental milestones as quickly as her siblings, and often appears lethargic. Physical exam reveals microcephaly, very light pigmentation (as compared to her family), and a "musty" body odor. The varied manifestations of this disease can most likely be attributed to which of the following genetic principles?
###Options:
A. Anticipation
B. Multiple gene mutations
C. Pleiotropy
D. Variable expressivity


### Response:

A. Anticipation is the process by which the severity of a disease is increased in successive generations due to the inheritance of a gene with a dominant negative effect.

B. Multiple gene mutations is the process by which multiple genes are mutated in a single individual, leading to a more severe phenotype.

C. Pleiotropy is the process by which one gene can lead to multiple diseases.

D. Variable expressivity is the process by which the severity of a disease can vary from one individual to another.


### Correct Answer:

A. Anticipation is the process by which the severity of a disease is increased in successive generations due to the inheritance of a gene with a dominant negative effect.


### Feedback:

Correct.
