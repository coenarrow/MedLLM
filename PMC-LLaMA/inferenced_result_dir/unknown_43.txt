There are no murmurs, rubs, or gallops but heart sounds are distant. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of this patient's symptoms?
###Options:
A. Chronic decrease in pulmonary compliance
B. Local accumulation of kinins
C. Progressive obstruction of expiratory airflow
D. Incremental loss of functional residual capacity
