### Input:
###Question: A 69-year-old man is brought by his son to the emergency department with weakness in his right arm and leg. The man insists that he is fine and blames his son for "creating panic". Four hours ago the patient was having tea with his wife when he suddenly dropped his teacup. He has had difficulty moving his right arm since then and cannot walk because his right leg feels stuck. He has a history of hypertension and dyslipidemia, for which he currently takes lisinopril and atorvastatin, respectively. He is allergic to aspirin and peanuts. A computerized tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an ischemic stroke. Which medication would most likely prevent such attacks in this patient in the future?
###Options:
A. Alteplase
B. Urokinase
C. Celecoxib
D. Clopidogrel


### Response:

A. Alteplase is the most appropriate option.

B. Urokinase is the most appropriate option.

C. Celecoxib is the most appropriate option.

D. Clopidogrel is the most appropriate option.


### Correct Answer:

A. Alteplase is the most appropriate option.


### Explanation:

Alteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades the fibrin clot. It is used to treat ischemic stroke.
