<s>Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Instruction:
In your capacity as a doctor, it is expected that you answer the medical questions relying on the patient's description.
Answer with the best option directly.

### Input:
###Question: A 4-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department by his parents. He is lethargic and confused and has a severe headache, vomiting, and a high-grade fever since earlier that day. His mother reports that the child was doing well until 2 days ago when he developed a fever and green nasal discharge. The patient has a history of neonatal sepsis, meningococcemia at 18 months of age, and pneumococcal pneumonia at 2 and 3 years of age. His scheduled vaccinations are up to date. His blood pressure is 70/50 mm Hg, heart rate is 120/min, respiratory rate is 22/min, and temperature is 39.3°C (102.4°F). On examination, the child is lethargic and his skin is pale, with several petechiae over his buttocks. There is a purulent nasal discharge from both nostrils. The lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are normal. There is marked neck rigidity. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows the following results:
Opening pressure 100 mm H2O
Appearance cloudy
Protein 500 mg/dL (5 g/L)
White blood cells 2500/μL (polymorphonuclear predominance)
Protein 450 mg/dL (4.5 g/L)
Glucose 31 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L)
Culture positive for N. meningitidis
Which of the following immunological processes is most likely to be impaired in this child?
###Options:
A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells
B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II
C. Formation of C5-9 complex
D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b


### Response:

A. Production of IL-2 by Th1 cells -Incorrect.

B. Activation of TCRs by MHC-II -Incorrect.

C. Formation of C5-9 complex -Incorrect.

D. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b -Incorrect.


###


Correct Answer:

C. Cleavage of C2 component of complement into C2a and C2b -Correct.


###


Explanation:

The correct answer is C. The patient's immune system is impaired because of the production of C2a and C2b, which are the cleavage products of C2 component of complement.
